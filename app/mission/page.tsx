          1 in 8 women will get breast cancer. 1 in 3 of these women with breast
          cancer will get Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC).

          All women who die from breast cancer, die from stage IV Metastatic
          Breast Cancer. Median survival after a Metastatic Breast Cancer
          diagnosis is 3 years. Only 2% to 5% of funds raised for breast cancer
          research is allocated to the Metastatic Breast Cancer patient. There
          is no cure for MBC.
